      "question": "The electromagnetic waves travel with velocity",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Equal to that of light",
        "b": "Equal to velocity of sound",
        "c": "Less than the velocity of light",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct: EM waves travel at the speed of light in a vacuum (â‰ˆ 3 x 10^8 m/s).",
        "b": "Incorrect: Speed of sound is much slower than EM waves.",
        "c": "Incorrect: In vacuum, EM wave speed equals light speed.",
